# Open questions

The full text of every question open for Bader, by its fixed ID. steps/PROGRESS.md and the top entry of steps/log.md list them by ID and a title of at most 8 words. A closed question moves to steps/questions-closed.md with its answer and date. Q088 to Q094 were closed by Q095 as known limits and are in steps/latent.md. Find a question by grep of its ID, never read this file whole.

Every question open before 2026-10-29 was closed in the answer pass of Round FOLD (steps/questions-closed.md, their text as asked in steps/history/questions-2026-10-29.md).

## Open

Q148 Place villas before Floors and Levels after 5c. Q149 M14 boundary wall of an irregular plot.

Q148. Place villas before Floors and Levels in the run after 5c (Round FOLD, review of the design PR 102). The new order of docs/design/13-workflow-changes.md has each step wait for the one before, so 7 Place villas waits for 6 Levels, and 5d builds 5 Floors and ramps and 6 Levels. The phase changes of 28 Oct 2026 give 5c the Place villas button with light mode, and the Revit run after 5c places villas in Masses and in one NBH in Links. Round FOLD wrote that the test host runs 7 by Buttons.Run on the plan before 5 and 6 are built (CHOSEN, steps/01_next.md). It does not block 5b or 5c.
- Recommended: keep it. The test host runs 7 from the plan in the run after 5c, which measures light mode and the base boundary as 28 Oct asks, and the pane keeps the order, so a user cannot run 7 before 6.
- Other: move Place villas and light mode to 5d, after 5 and 6, and the run after 5c places nothing.

Q149. M14, the boundary wall of an irregular plot (Round FOLD, docs/design/15-manual-rules.md). The canvas text reads "boundary wall 200 mm inside the plot limit". The Rev 06 manual, 2.8.A, p. 20 (PDF 23), reads "the boundary wall external face will be identical to the plot limit, and the 200mm will be positioned fully inside the plot", the outer face on the limit and the 200 mm wall thickness inside it. The canvas text is kept until Bader answers. It does not block, M14 is checked by 8 Walls in 5d.
- Recommended: the PDF reading, the outer face of the wall on the plot limit and its 200 mm inside the plot, and the canvas text written so.
- Other: the wall 200 mm in from the plot limit, as the canvas text can be read.

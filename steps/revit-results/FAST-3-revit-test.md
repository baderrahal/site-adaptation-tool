# FAST-3-revit-test, Revit check, run 1

Run 1 of the one test, Sat 7 Nov 2026 from 01:11. Lane revit-test, Revit 2024.3, one Revit under python/window_lock.py, round FAST-3-revit-test. The add-in is the one Lead built from main 14044dd and installed at 23:00 on 6 Nov.

Every press and every value set here came from a driver of this lane, not from a person. The driver is Lead's copy of drive3.ps1 at a fixed path of the work root, from the driver of R2-C1-revit-test. It sends a click, a key or a shot only with Revit in front and stops on any input that is not its own. Its own log is driver.log of the folder `fast3-revit-test/shots/run1` of the work root.

Screenshots of the real run show real coordinates, plot numbers, file names and the user name of this machine. They stay under the work root, folder `fast3-revit-test/shots/run1`, never in git.

## Times

- 23:33 Fri: lane started. 23:43 a Teams window "Meeting compact view" stood, so nothing was sent.
- 00:16 Sat, Bader's order by Lead: that one Teams window keeps the laptop awake and is no meeting window. Any other meeting window still stops the driver.
- 00:46 the launch of the driver was refused by the permission check of this session. 01:15 Bader allowed one command form.
- 01:11:09 Revit opened on the model copy, process 46028.
- 01:11:56 the box "Security - Unsigned Add-In" of Site Adaptation came and the driver pressed Always Load, Bader's order of 23:37. File always_load.txt of the run folder holds the time.
- 01:20 VS Code came in front with fresh input. The driver sent nothing and waited for 5 minutes idle, then went on at 01:29:55.
- 01:48 one click aimed at a button below the visible pane landed on the taskbar, which took the focus. Nothing opened there. The driver now refuses any point outside the visible Revit window, and brought Revit back in front only after checking that no other input had come.

## Model and folder

- Model: `FAST3-empty-model.rvt` in the folder fast3-revit-test of the work root, a fresh copy of the empty model of R2-C1, a project made from the Revit metric template. Proof it is an empty model: the project browser holds only Level 1, Level 2 and Site plans, no Revit link, and Set up site opened with the badge "Empty project found" and "This model has no site coordinates" (shots s01-start.png, s10-setup-site.png).
- Folder: S1 of the scenarios of the work root, chosen in the pane by Choose project folder. SHA-256, size and write time of its 37 files were taken before the run into s1_before.json of the run folder.

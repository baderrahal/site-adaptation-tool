## Round 1, 2026-10-22, read-only readers

Done:
- RAN: Python tests, 18 passed, locally and on CI (run 39768241302, Ubuntu, Python 3.12)
- RAN: .NET tests, 22 passed, locally and on CI (windows-latest, .NET Framework 4.8)
- CAD path used: C#, ACadSharp 3.8.0. The ezdxf fallback was not needed
- RAN: ACadSharp opened three real AC1032 DWGs from the AutoCAD 2026 install with no reader errors (Civil Best Practices Guide current.dwg and source.dwg, Civil Tutorials Align-1.dwg). Smoke check only. They are not site data and not in the repo
- Found on that run: ACadSharp PlainText turned a label into LLOT 17l. MTextCleaner now strips the codes, with a test
- READ: pdfplumber 0.11.7, pdfminer.six and openpyxl 3.1.5 are MIT, from the installed package metadata. PyMuPDF is not installed or referenced
- Revit add-in compiles against the Nice3point Revit 2024.3.60 API package. It was not run in Revit
- docs/rules.md holds R1 to R15. Each rule is named by a test, except R6, R10 and R11 which are process rules
- Gate in .github/workflows/test.yml. Zero tests fails the job (pytest exit 5, trx count on .NET)
- R15 reading: C# statement semicolons are syntax and are the one exception. Prose and comments follow the rule

Remains:
- Any run on a real PDF, workbook or Revit file. No sample of those exists in the repo, so each of those readers stops at its dummy test
- The harness for this repo (CLAUDE.md, hooks, steps README and PROGRESS, checker agents). Not built this round
- The week one stress test round, before any placement work

Known bugs:
- UNKNOWN: the Revit command has never run inside Revit. Parameter values, level names and the family bounding box are unproven
- CHOSEN: the default key parameters are Width, Height, Depth, Length, Area, Mark, Type Mark, Description. They are my pick, not a stated list
- Revit: parameters match by English name. Project files list loadable family types only, not system families or groups
- Revit family files: insertion point is the family origin, level is empty, bounding box covers solid forms and nested instances only
- CAD: model space only. Lines, arcs and splines are not listed. Polyline bulges are ignored
- CAD: a dense drawing makes a big plots.json. Align-1.dwg gave 552 KB for 579 polylines
- PDF: labels are single words, so PLOT 12 is two labels. Curves are not read
- Excel: the first non-empty row is taken as the header row. The sheet defaults to Coordinates
- This session started outside the repo, so no hooks were live

Next:
- Run the Revit command on one prototype family in Revit 2024 and read prototypes.json against the family
- Then drop one real file per reader into a sample folder and confirm each reader against it

Your turn:
1. Which parameters count as key? Recommended: send the 8 to 12 names, they go in key-parameters.txt, no code change
2. May a small real DWG, PDF and coordinates workbook go into this private repo for tests? Recommended: yes, one each, added with git add -f. Say no if the client files must stay off GitHub
3. Should PDF labels stay as single words? Recommended: yes until a real PDF shows how plot labels are laid out
4. Build the harness next round, before any new reader work? Recommended: yes
5. Run the add-in. Open Revit 2024, run External Tools, Read Prototypes, pick a prototype .rfa, send back prototypes.json. Steps are in README.md

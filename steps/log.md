# Round log

Newest entry first. The top entry is one page at most. Older rounds keep a short stub here and the detail lives in steps/history/.

## Round 3, 2026-10-22, fixes against the real files

Detail: [steps/history/round-3.md](history/round-3.md).
Excel header row and stop rules fixed, El @ Entry and Height kept at 4 decimals. CAD plot geometry read from MP_PLOT_LINE (777 closed shapes, 28 open pieces). One more PDF sheet read and the layout held on all 12. Gate at the end of the round was Python 24 passed and .NET 28 passed.

## Round 2, 2026-10-22, readers run on real ROSHN Makkah files

Detail: [steps/history/round-2.md](history/round-2.md).
First run of the four readers on the real files. Excel, PDF and CAD ran, Revit did not. The list of mismatches found there drove round 3. Gate at the end of the round was Python 18 passed and .NET 22 passed.

## Round 1, 2026-10-22, read-only readers

Done:
- RAN: Python tests, 18 passed, locally and on CI (run 39768241302, Ubuntu, Python 3.12)
- RAN: .NET tests, 22 passed, locally and on CI (windows-latest, .NET Framework 4.8)
- CAD path used: C#, ACadSharp 3.8.0. The ezdxf fallback was not needed
- RAN: ACadSharp opened three real AC1032 DWGs from the AutoCAD 2026 install with no reader errors (Civil Best Practices Guide current.dwg and source.dwg, Civil Tutorials Align-1.dwg). Smoke check only. They are not site data and not in the repo
- Found on that run: ACadSharp PlainText turned a label into LLOT 17l. MTextCleaner now strips the codes, with a test
- READ: pdfplumber 0.11.7, pdfminer.six and openpyxl 3.1.5 are MIT, from the installed package metadata. PyMuPDF is not installed or referenced
- Revit add-in compiles against the Nice3point Revit 2024.3.60 API package. It was not run in Revit
- docs/rules.md holds R1 to R15. Each rule is named by a test, except R6, R10 and R11 which are process rules
- Gate in .github/workflows/test.yml. Zero tests fails the job (pytest exit 5, trx count on .NET)
- R15 reading: C# statement semicolons are syntax and are the one exception. Prose and comments follow the rule

Remains:
- Any run on a real PDF, workbook or Revit file. No sample of those exists in the repo, so each of those readers stops at its dummy test
- The harness for this repo (CLAUDE.md, hooks, steps README and PROGRESS, checker agents). Not built this round
- The week one stress test round, before any placement work

Known bugs:
- UNKNOWN: the Revit command has never run inside Revit. Parameter values, level names and the family bounding box are unproven
- CHOSEN: the default key parameters are Width, Height, Depth, Length, Area, Mark, Type Mark, Description. They are my pick, not a stated list
- Revit: parameters match by English name. Project files list loadable family types only, not system families or groups
- Revit family files: insertion point is the family origin, level is empty, bounding box covers solid forms and nested instances only
- CAD: model space only. Lines, arcs and splines are not listed. Polyline bulges are ignored
- CAD: a dense drawing makes a big plots.json. Align-1.dwg gave 552 KB for 579 polylines
- PDF: labels are single words, so PLOT 12 is two labels. Curves are not read
- Excel: the first non-empty row is taken as the header row. The sheet defaults to Coordinates
- This session started outside the repo, so no hooks were live

Next:
- Run the Revit command on one prototype family in Revit 2024 and read prototypes.json against the family
- Then drop one real file per reader into a sample folder and confirm each reader against it

Your turn:
1. Which parameters count as key? Recommended: send the 8 to 12 names, they go in key-parameters.txt, no code change
2. May a small real DWG, PDF and coordinates workbook go into this private repo for tests? Recommended: yes, one each, added with git add -f. Say no if the client files must stay off GitHub
3. Should PDF labels stay as single words? Recommended: yes until a real PDF shows how plot labels are laid out
4. Build the harness next round, before any new reader work? Recommended: yes
5. Run the add-in. Open Revit 2024, run External Tools, Read Prototypes, pick a prototype .rfa, send back prototypes.json. Steps are in README.md
